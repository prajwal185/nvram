I can't access your actual Google Cloud project to find your specific values for GCP_PROJECT_ID, GCS_BUCKET_NAME, and JWT_SECRET_ID. I'm an AI assistant and do not have access to your personal cloud resources or any external systems.

You will need to retrieve these values yourself from your Google Cloud Console.

How to Find Your Values
1. GCP_PROJECT_ID
This is the unique identifier for your project.

Go to the Google Cloud Console.

In the top navigation bar, you'll see a project name and ID. Click on it to open the project selection dialog.

Your project ID will be listed there.

2. GCS_BUCKET_NAME
This is the name of the Cloud Storage bucket you created for this project.

In the Cloud Console, navigate to the Cloud Storage section.

Click on Buckets.

The names of all your buckets will be listed. Use the name of the bucket you intend to use for the filesystem.

3. JWT_SECRET_ID
This is the name of the secret you created in Secret Manager to store your JWT key.

In the Cloud Console, go to Secret Manager.

You will see a list of all your secrets. The JWT_SECRET_ID is the name you gave to the secret that holds the key for signing your JWT tokens.
